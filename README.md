Hi, I'm a CPU Design and Verification Intern at [InCore Semiconductors](https://incoresemi.com/).
>
I completed my B Tech in Electronics and Communication from [PES University](https://pes.edu/), with a VLSI Specialization, Teaching Assistant experience for three core subjects, and eight Cadence Digital Badges for the 'Digital Design and Signoff' track. 

I have earlier worked at IIITB, IISC (OrbitAID), CIE PESU and CIOT PESU.

#### Digital Design
* Designed [Low Power Hardware Accelerator for Multidimensional Data Sorting](https://github.com/govardhnn/Low_Power_Multidimensional_Sorters) for my B Tech Capstone Project at PES University <br> 
**[IEEE CONECCT: [Paper Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10234758)]**
* I'm certified with 8 Cadence Digital Badges for the Digital Design flow. ([Link to my badges](https://www.credly.com/users/sai-govardhan/badges))
* Was the mentor for the FPGA Track at [CIE PESU](https://github.com/CIE-PESU)
* [Bluespexamples](https://github.com/govardhnn/Bluespexamples), more like Bluespec Examples of Digital Designs.
   
#### Computer Architecture

* [Single Cycle RISC-V Processor](https://github.com/govardhnn/RISC_V_Single_Cycle_Processor) 
* [RISC-V Assembly level Programs](https://github.com/govardhnn/RISC_V_Assembly_Programs) 
* I've received the NPTEL Online Certification for the Advanced Computer Architecture course
* Guide: Processor Benchmarking with [SPEC CPU 2017](https://github.com/CIE-PESU/DE10_FPGA)
  
#### Scripting:
* [TCLish](https://github.com/govardhnn/TCLish) - a guide to TCL Scripting basics


#### My PES Student Teaching Assistant resources 
(Please mail me at [saigovardhanmc@pesu.pes.edu](mailto:saigovardhanmc@pesu.pes.edu) for any doubts only if you're a student from one of the below courses)
* [Embedded Firmware Development with UEFI](https://github.com/govardhnn/UEFI_AHP)
* Synthesis, Physical Design, and Timing Analysis of Digital Circuits (Manual: [bit.ly/mentorlabpesu](https://bit.ly/mentorlabpesu))
* [Digital System Design](https://github.com/govardhnn/DSD_AHP) (Manual: [bit.ly/cadencelabpesu](https://bit.ly/cadencelabpesu))

#### Other Projects
* Built [Farmbot](https://github.com/govardhnn/farmbot-pesu), during my time interning at Centre for IOT, PESU.
