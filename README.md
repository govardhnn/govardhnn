Hi, I'm a ```CPU Design and Verification Intern``` at InCore Semiconductors. <br><br>
I have completed my B Tech in Electronics and Communication from PES University, Bangalore with a VLSI Specialisation and have worked as:
* ``` VLSI Design Intern ``` at IIIT Bangalore (Advisor: Dr. G N Srinivasa Prasanna) 
* ``` Hardware Accelerator Research Intern ``` at [CIE PESU](https://github.com/CIE-PESU) and also mentored the FPGA track of the CIE SWS. 
* ``` Electronics Research Intern ``` at OrbitAID Aerospace, IISC.
* ``` Project Intern - Farmbot ``` at Center for IoT, PESU
>
The highlights of my work are:
<br>
#### Digital Design
* Designed [Low Power Hardware Accelerator for Multidimensional Data Sorting](https://github.com/govardhnn/Low_Power_Multidimensional_Sorters) for my B Tech Capstone Project at PES University <br> Our paper has been presented at IEEE CONECCT
* I'm certified with 8 Cadence Digital Badges for the Digital Design flow. ([Link to my badges](https://www.credly.com/users/sai-govardhan/badges))

#### Computer Architecture

* [Single Cycle RISC-V Processor](https://github.com/govardhnn/RISC_V_Single_Cycle_Processor) 
* [RISC-V Assembly level Programs](https://github.com/govardhnn/RISC_V_Assembly_Programs) 
* I've received the NPTEL Online Certification for the Advanced Computer Architecture course

#### Guides and Examples to:
* Processor Benchmarking with [SPEC CPU 2017](https://github.com/govardhnn/SPEC_CPU_2017) 
* [TCLish](https://github.com/govardhnn/TCLish) - a guide to TCL Scripting basics
* [Bluespexamples](https://github.com/govardhnn/Bluespexamples), more like Bluespec examples
