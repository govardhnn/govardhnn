Hi, I'm a B.Tech ECE senior from PESU, Bangalore with a VLSI Specialisation and a passion for Digital Design and Computer Architecture. \
I'm currently working at the Computational Sciences Labs - IIIT Bangalore (Advisor: Dr. G N Srinivasa Prasanna) and am also a part of the FPGA Design group at [CIE PESU](https://github.com/CIE-PESU). I previously worked as an Electronics Intern at OrbitAID Aerospace, IISC. \
The highlights of my work are:

#### Digital Design
* Designed [Low Power Hardware Accelerator for Multidimensional Data Sorting](https://github.com/govardhnn/Low_Power_Multidimensional_Sorters) using for my B.Tech Capstone Project at PES University <br> Our paper is accepted at IEEE CONECCT and the code will be made public after publication
* [Neuromorphic Computing](https://github.com/govardhnn/Neuromorphic_Computing) from my internship at the Computational Sciences Labs - IIIT Bangalore (ongoing)
* I'm certified with 8 Cadence Digital Badges for the Digital Design flow. ([Link to my badges](https://www.credly.com/users/sai-govardhan/badges))

#### Computer Architecture
* [RISC_V_Pipelined_Processor](https://github.com/govardhnn/RISC_V_Pipelined_Processor) 
* [Single Cycle RISC-V Processor](https://github.com/govardhnn/RISC_V_Single_Cycle_Processor) 


#### Verification
A comprehensive compilation of all Functional and Formal [Verification](https://github.com/govardhnn/Verification) concepts on SystemVerilog

#### Processor Benchmarking
[SPEC CPU 2017](https://github.com/govardhnn/SPEC_CPU_2017) 

#### My PES Student Teaching Assistant resources 
(Please mail me at saigovardhanmc@pesu.pes.edu for any additional resources, only if you're a student from one of the below courses)
* [Embedded Firmware Development with UEFI](https://github.com/govardhnn/UEFI_AHP)
* Synthesis, Physical Design and Timing Analysis of  Digital Circuits (Manual: [bit.ly/mentorlabpesu](https://bit.ly/mentorlabpesu))
* [Digital System Design](https://github.com/govardhnn/DSD_AHP) (Manual: [bit.ly/cadencelabpesu](https://bit.ly/cadencelabpesu))

#### Other Projects
* Built [Farmbot](https://github.com/govardhnn/farmbot-pesu), during my time interning at Centre for IOT, PESU.
* Proposed and built the [PESU Student Support Platform](https://ssp.pes.edu).
